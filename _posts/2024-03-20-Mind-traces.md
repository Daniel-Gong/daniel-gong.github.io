This post is to keep track of whether I have written down something in my notebook every day.

For the last 8 or 9 years, I‘ve been keeping the habit of writing down my "mind traces" in notebooks (sometimes in digital forms). It started sometime in 2015 or 2016, and I have filled up countless notebooks. However, when life gets busy, it is not that easy to always remind yourself to do something every day. Here I will keep a record of this.
