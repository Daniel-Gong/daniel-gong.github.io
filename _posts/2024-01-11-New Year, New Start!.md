I'm back! I just realized I had a blog and I should probably update it. I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep up with it, but I'll try. I'm not sure what I'll write about, but I'll try to keep it interesting. I'm not sure if anyone will read it, but I'll try to make it worth your while.

2024 is gonna be a great year. I can feel it.
