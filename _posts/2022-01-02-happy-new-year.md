Time flies! It's already 2022! Happy New Year!

2021 was a transformative year in terms of my understanding of the approaches we should take in neuroscience research. Cognitive neuroscience can't answer the ultimate questions of human intelligence if we satisfy with just observing new phenomena using whatever techniques.

We need formal models. We need precise descriptions and predictions of neural computing to uncover the mystery of how cognition emerges from the human brain. Mathemathics, physics, and artificial intelligence - these will be helpful to lead us to a really interdisciplinary approach to neuroscience.
