Is it possible to stop browsing social media contents for one month? I really want to give myself a test... Starting March 11th 10:53 pm, I will record if this is possible over the next 30 days...

✅ I actually opened twitter to browse some research-related content (it's posted on twitter)- and I realized it is nearly impossible to stay totally away from social media. Sometimes you have to use it to get latest information.

❎ Well well well, stayed up late and ended up scrolling some social media while waiting for some data processing on the computer to be done:)

❎ Weekend. Went out for a stroll and posted something. Yes social media is not all bad - we need it to record some life moments and keep connections with friends.
