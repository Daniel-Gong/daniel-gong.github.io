Interesting paper collection

We all know that kind of feeling when you discover some very interesting paper but you never really have time to read it. Maybe you just throw it to Zotero and it stays there forever. Pobably posting the interesting/useful papers here will give me some more motivation to revisit them later? Let's try.
