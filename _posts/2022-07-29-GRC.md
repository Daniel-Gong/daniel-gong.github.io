Haven't posted here for a while!

Just spent a wonderful week in Maine, United States for the Gordon Research Conference (and Seminar) on Neurobiology of Cognition.

Packed schedule every day, but also being hyper every day.

Learned so much from talks, posters, and discussions with faculties, postdocs, and fellow graduate students attending the conference.

Got lots of constructive feedback for my poster!

Also made a bunch of amazing friends!

Looking forward to the next GRC Neurobiology of Cognition (2024)!
