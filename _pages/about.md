Hi, I'm Dongyu Gong! I am currently a PhD student studying neuroscience at Yale University.

Before transferring to Yale, I started my PhD at the University of Oxford funded by [Clarendon Scholarship](https://ox.ac.uk/clarendon), [UK Medical Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/), and [New College](https://www.new.ox.ac.uk/). My current PhD advisor is Professor Anna Christina (Kia) Nobre and I moved to Yale after Kia got her new position at Yale.

I am interested in both human intelligence and machine intelligence, especially how intelligence emerges from biological systems and artificial systems. I believe neuroscience and cogntive science will provide valuable insights for the development of [autonomous machine intelligence](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf) with human-level cognitive abilities.

I am updating a list of [interesting {NeuroAI/CompNeuro/LLM-Cognition/EmbodiedAI/miscellaneous} articles/readings/guides.](https://daniel-gong.github.io/Discovering-Interesting-Papers/).

My PhD research currently focuses on the neural mechanisms underlying human visual attention and memory, especially how they interact to allow flexible and adaptive human behavior.

Before graduate school, I received my degree of Bachelor of Science from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) with [highest honors](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sPpt0fUmPgi2dTujhMV3Ww). During my undergraduate years, I was supervised by Professor [Pei Sun](http://www.psych.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxxen/info/1073/1132.htm) and Professor [Nihong Chen](http://www.psych.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxxen/info/1072/1100.htm) at Tsinghua. In Summer 2019, I visited [Whitney lab](https://whitneylab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. In Winter 2019, I visited Professor [Jan Theeuwes](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/jan-theeuwes/)'s lab at VU Amsterdam. In Summer 2020, I worked with Professor [Jeremy Wolfe](https://eye.hms.harvard.edu/jeremywolfe), who leads the [Visual Attention Lab](https://search.bwh.harvard.edu/new/index.html) at Harvard Medical School.

In my leisure time, I enjoy cooking, running, travelling, and hiking. I also love sci-fi, [photography](https://daniel-gong.github.io/photography), and piano music.

# **News**

**- 2024.6** I was selected as a participant for the [2024 Analytical Connectionism Summer School](https://events.simonsfoundation.org/event/e070287e-741e-4809-adea-7269142737cb/summary)! The summer school only admits ~38 participants. I have also been awarded a travel scholarship to attend the summer school.

**- 2024.4** I gave a [talk](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/documents/CNS_2024_Program_Booklet.pdf) at CNS Annual Meeting!

**- 2024.2** I presented my [paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/28868) at AAAI conference on Artificial Intelligence!
