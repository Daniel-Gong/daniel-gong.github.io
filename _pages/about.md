Hi, I'm Dongyu Gong. I am a PhD student at the [Brain & Cognition Laboratory](http://www.brainandcognition.org/), University of Oxford. I am supervised by Professor [Anna Christina Nobre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Christina_Nobre), and I am fully funded by [Clarendon Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarendon_Fund) & [Medical Research Council (MRC)](https://mrc.ukri.org/).

Before graduate school, I received my degree of Bachelor of Science from [Tsinghua University](tsinghua.edu.cn) with highest honors. During my undergraduate years, I was supervised by Professor [Pei Sun](http://www.psych.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxxen/info/1073/1132.htm) and Professor [Nihong Chen](http://www.psych.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxxen/info/1072/1100.htm) at Tsinghua. In Summer 2019, I visited [Whitney lab](https://whitneylab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. In Winter 2019, I visited Professor [Jan Theeuwes](https://www.vupsy.nl/staff-members/jan-theeuwes/)'s lab at VU Amsterdam. In Summer 2020, I worked with Professor [Jeremy Wolfe](http://researchfaculty.brighamandwomens.org/BRIProfile.aspx?id=552), who leads the [Visual Attention Lab](https://search.bwh.harvard.edu/new/index.html) at Harvard University.

My research area is Cognitive Neuroscience, and I mainly focus on the neural mechanisms underlying attention and working memory, especially how they interact to allow flexible and adaptive human behavior. I use a combination of functional MRI, EEG/MEG, and human psyhchophysics techniques in my research.
