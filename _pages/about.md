Hi I'm Dongyu Gong, currently an undergraduate at [Tsinghua University](tsinghua.edu.cn). I will join the [Brain & Cognition Laboratory](http://www.brainandcognition.org/) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford as a PhD student starting from 2021 fall. I will be advised by Professor [Kia Nobre](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/kia-nobre-1).

During my undergraduate years, I am advised by [Dr. Pei Sun](http://www.psych.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxxen/info/1073/1132.htm) and [Dr. Nihong Chen](http://www.psych.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxxen/info/1072/1100.htm). In Summer 2019, I visited [Whitney lab](https://whitneylab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. In Winter 2019, I visited Professor [Jan Theeuwes](https://www.vupsy.nl/staff-members/jan-theeuwes/)'s lab at VU Amsterdam.

My research interests lie in various topics in cognitive neuroscience, especially the neural mechanisms underlying the interactions between human perception, attention, memory, and learning. I will use a combination of functional MRI, EEG/MEG, and human psyhchophysics techniques in my research.
