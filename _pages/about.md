Hi, I'm Dongyu Gong! I am currently a PhD student studying neuroscience at Yale University.

Before transferring to Yale, I was a PhD student at the University of Oxford. I moved to Yale after my advisor (Professor Kia Nobre) got her new position at Yale.

I am interested in both human intelligence and machine intelligence, especially how intelligence emerges from biological systems and artificial systems. I believe neuroscience and cogntive science will provide valuable insights for the development of [autonomous machine intelligence](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf) with human-level cognitive abilities.

I am updating a list of [interesting NeuroAI/CompNeuro/miscellaneous readings](https://daniel-gong.github.io/posts/2024/neuroai-readings/).

Before graduate school, I studied psychology and computer science (minor) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and graduated with [highest honors](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sPpt0fUmPgi2dTujhMV3Ww).

In my leisure time, I enjoy cooking, running, travelling, and hiking. I also love sci-fi, photography, and piano music.
