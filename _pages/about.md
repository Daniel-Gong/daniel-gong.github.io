Hi, I'm Dongyu Gong! I am currently a PhD student in Neuroscience working in the [Cognitive and Neural Computation Lab](https://cncl.yale.edu/) and the [Brain and Cognition Lab](https://brainandcognition.org/) at Yale University.

Before coming to Yale, I was a PhD student at the University of Oxford. I moved to Yale after my advisor got a new position at Yale.

I am interested in both human intelligence and machine intelligence, especially how intelligence emerges from biological systems and artificial systems. I believe neuroscience and cogntive science will provide valuable insights for the development of [autonomous machine intelligence](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf) with human-level cognitive abilities.

If you are also interested in NeuroAI (neuroscience for AI and AI for neuroscience), you might be interested in this list of [NeuroAI/CompNeuro readings](https://github.com/Daniel-Gong/NeuroAI-Readings) that I am updating regularly.

Before graduate school, I studied psychology and computer science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and graduated with [highest honors](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/iEbIbvhj_Rtmihr-ICV1DA). A book chapter about me can be found in [Youth Profiles of Tsinghua](https://www.amazon.com/%E6%B8%85%E5%8D%8E%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E8%AF%B4-%E7%AC%AC6%E8%BE%91-%E5%8C%BF%E5%90%8D/dp/7302591709). An interview can be found on the [website of Tsinghua University News](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1181/85313.htm).

In my leisure time, I enjoy playing tennis, running, travelling, and hiking. I also love sci-fi, photography, and piano music.
