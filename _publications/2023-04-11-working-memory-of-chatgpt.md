Working memory is a critical aspect of both human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI), serving as a workspace for the temporary storage and manipulation of information. This paper investigates the working memory capacity of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model, by examining its performance on N-back tasks. We begin by discussing the importance of working memory to humans and AI, followed by the methods employed to assess ChatGPTâ€™s working memory capacity. Our study compares behavioral performance of ChatGPT on verbal and spatial N-back tasks to that of human participants reported in the literature, revealing notable similarities. Our findings offer crucial insights into the current progress in designing AI systems with humanlevel cognitive abilities and hold promise for informing future endeavors aimed at enhancing AI working memory and understanding human working memory through AI models.
