We investigated how attention operates differently in human working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM). The study reveals that while attentional cues enhance retrieval performance in both WM and LTM, the mechanisms and observable effects differ between the two. Specifically, attentional orienting in WM is associated with significant gaze shifts and microsaccades, indicating a more pronounced and perhaps more automatic engagement of attention. In contrast, such gaze biases are absent in LTM, suggesting a different mode of attentional engagement. For cognitive science and neuroscience researchers, I believe this paper can provide valuable insights into the nuanced ways attention interacts with different memory systems in humans.

On the other hand, recently I have been very interested in how research on human cognitive and neural computation can help us better understand the essence of intelligence and potentially design more human-like artificial intelligence. Below are several implications that the findings from this paper might have for hashtag#LLM research, or hashtag#NeuroAI at large, particularly concerning the interplay between attention mechanisms and memory representations:

üéØ Differentiated Attention Mechanisms: The distinction between how attention operates in WM and LTM suggests that LLMs might benefit from implementing differentiated attention mechanisms. Currently, attention in LLMs is largely uniform across different types of information. Incorporating mechanisms that mimic the distinct attentional processes observed in human WM and LTM could enhance the models' ability to handle tasks requiring different memory engagements.

‚è≥ Temporal Dynamics of Attention: The study's observation that attentional effects in WM are more immediate and pronounced, while those in LTM are subtler, points to the importance of temporal dynamics in attention. LLMs could be designed to adjust their attention mechanisms based on the recency or relevance of information, akin to how human attention varies between WM and LTM.

üß© Integration of Sensory and Memory Information: The interaction between attention and sensory processing, especially the finding that attention in WM can influence the perception of unrelated stimuli, suggests that LLMs might improve by integrating sensory-like processing with memory representations. This could involve developing architectures that allow for dynamic interactions between different layers or modules, reflecting the bidirectional influence observed in human cognition.

By drawing inspiration from these mechanisms, I think LLM research can explore more sophisticated and human-like models of attention and memory, potentially leading to improvements in tasks that require complex information retrieval and processing.
